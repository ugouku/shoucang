## Building for production

To optimize the expper client for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your browser.

## Testing

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript` and can be run with:

    grunt test
    
UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in `src/test/javascript/e2e` 
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./gradlew bootRun`) and running the tests (`grunt itest`) in a second one.
